- Columns we want to analyze:
  (1) Learning Style*
  (2) Career Goals

- Create two separate visualizations for each in order to accurately show the class distribution; we may discuss finding a correlation between the two at another time.

I. Curating the Data
a) Learning Style Data
  - eliminate unusual data (count as null)
      - this way we will not run into any skewed biases 
  - Suggestion: create a matrix
    - 4 columns (one for each category); the students' results as each of the entries

b) Career Goal Data
  - Suggestion 1: group the data into industries; ie Business, Tech, Actuarial Science, etc.
  - Suggestion 2: Each title is a separate category; ie Statistician, Data Analyst, etc.
    - for entries with more than one job title, split the weightage (so if someone put down 2 options, each entry will count as 0.5)

II. Analyzing and Visualizing the Data
  a) Learning Style Data
    - Suggestion: box and whisker plot
        - take note of median, mean, range of results
      
  b) Career Goal Data
    - Suggestion: stacked bar chart. Each title represents a distinct category, and the 4 stratifications are shown.
    
III. Presentation
  - HTML5
  - 2 graphs showing invidividual data, possibly 1 graph showing correlation
