Notes, Talking Points, and Questions for Group 11


**2013-10-03 Meeting**
---------------
- **Columns** we want to analyze:
  - Learning Style
  - Career Goals

- Create two **separate** visualizations for each in order to **accurately** show the class distribution
  - We may discuss finding a **correlation** between the two at another time.
  

I. Curating the Data
--------------
- Learning Style Data
  - eliminate unusual data (count as null); this way we will not run into any skewed biases 
  - Suggestion: create a matrix
    - 4 columns (one for each category); the students' results as each of the entries

- Career Goal Data
  - Suggestion 1: group the data into industries; ie Business, Tech, Actuarial Science, etc.
  - Suggestion 2: Each title is a separate category; ie Statistician, Data Analyst, etc.
    - for entries with more than one job title, split the weightage (so if someone put down 2 options, each entry will count as 0.5)

II. Analyzing & Visualizing the Data
----------------
- Learning Style Data
    - Suggestion: box and whisker plot
        - take note of median, mean, range of results
      
- Career Goal Data
    - Suggestion: stacked bar chart. Each title represents a distinct category, and the 4 stratifications are shown.
    
III. Presentation
-------------
  - HTML5
  - 2 graphs showing invidividual data, possibly 1 graph showing correlation
